# Google_Ad-Organic_search_results_share
<br/> Python script (back-end) created by **Dimitrios Panourgias**
<br/> June 2020

This script does not by any means aim to cause any harm to the website that uses to scrap data.
It is only for personal portfolio & educational purposes and not destined to be used by third parties for commercial or any other purpose that might harm the smooth operation of the source website.

:children_crossing: *This script is not maintained, so, in time, certain operations or even the entire script may not be functional.*

**Scope of the script:**
<br/> The script gets as input a *list of queries* (i.e. product names),
searches each query in Google Search bar,
***returns each ad result and each organic result in a table*** from the first page of search results.
The script also gets as input your shop's name,
for every ad result or/and organic result that 
your shop's name appears, the script returns 
a boolean (true/false) response ***along with the 
ad or/and organic position (ranking) of your shop*** in the same table.
Keep in mind that each performed search does not provide
constantly the exact same results.

# Further analysis

The collected data can be further processed (even visualized with the use of Excel, Google Sheets, Google Data Studio, Power BI, Tableau, dash, etc.) to provide useful insights for marketeers and shop owners like:

  <br/>   For an extensive list of queries/products:
    <br/>   - calculate the total share between paid/organic search results
    <br/>   - calculate your shop's share of paid/organic search results
    <br/>   - calculate your shop's share of a specific paid/organic position in search results
    
  <br/>   For each query/product:
    <br/>  - identify the aggressiveness of your advertizing (i.e. most aggressive for 1st position in paid results AND 1st position in organic results) and along with data from Google Ads, decide if you should increase or decrease the bidding for this keyword.
